The basic idea of the project is to conduct various data and time series analysis of real-time, present and past records of stocks. This data-driven approach will help manage an individual's portfolio and ultimately improve profit margins. We will connect the interface to the data in real time, first using the historical price data of selected stocks and interest rate assets, calculate the return of the portfolio, and evaluate the risk of the portfolio. Using stock analysis, time series analysis, time series model and other models to help forecast. Find a balance between return and risk, and ultimately choose the optimal investment portfolio.
